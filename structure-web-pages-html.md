# Wireframe and Design

- Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.

- Wireframing lets you plan the layout and interaction of your interface.

- The process used to get to from wireframe to code, is less related to the individual preference of the UX Designer, and much more related to what approach the particular situation requires. 

- In the bullet points below are a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:

  - Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
  
  - Sketch > Code
  
  - Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
  
  - Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

## How to make your wireframe in six steps

1 Research

2 Prepare research for reference

3 Have user flow mapped out

4  Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate

5 Add some detail and get testing

6 Start turning your wireframes into prototypes


# Semantics

## Semantics is the understanding of what a piece of code purpose is.

- In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?

- In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?

- In HTML, for example, the `h1` element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
