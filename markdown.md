# Markdown Notes

##### Markdown is a tool you can use to style texts on a document

## Markdown Examples

### Quoting

#### If youâ€™d like to quote someone, use the > character before the line

### Markdowning Code

#### There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
