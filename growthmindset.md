# Growth Mindset

***growth mindset in my own words is - mentally preparing yourslef for obstacles and challenges and look forward to overcoming those challenges rather than giving up when you feel stuck, also looking forward to making progress day by day rather than expecting to master the material in one day***

## reminder 1
**expect to make _day by day progress_ instead of _getting everything in one day_**

### reminder 2
**_use constrcutive criticism to my advantage_ so I can know what to work on**

### reminder 3
**I can _learn from others around me_ who may seem to understand the material better**
